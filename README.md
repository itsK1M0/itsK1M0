Hi m K1M0 ,
I’m a cybersecurity student passionate about breaking and securing systems. 
I’ve spent a lot of time practicing on TryHackMe and CTF challenges, exploring tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, and more.

I work with Linux and Windows environments, networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP), 
and hands-on security techniques from exploitation to defensive measures. 

This GitHub is where I experiment, learn in public, and build practical projects while sharpening my skills in real-world security scenarios.
